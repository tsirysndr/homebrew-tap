# Homebrew formula for bsdkrun-supervisor.
#
# Copy this into the tap repo as `Formula/bsdkrun-supervisor.rb`
# (github.com/tsirysndr/homebrew-tap) — Homebrew installs from the tap, not
# from here. It lives in this repo so it is versioned with the thing it ships.
#
# Not a user-facing tool: `bsdkrund` shells out to it to actually boot a
# machine (see supervisor/src/main.rs and daemon/src/supervisor.rs for why
# booting lives in a process of its own). Installing this formula puts it on
# PATH, which is where the daemon falls back to looking when it isn't sitting
# right beside `bsdkrund`.
#
# Installs prebuilt binaries from the GitHub release that `release.yml`
# publishes. To cut a new version: bump `version`, then read each `sha256`
# from the `.sha256` sidecar published beside its tarball, e.g.
#
#   curl -sL https://github.com/tsirysndr/bsdkrun/releases/download/v0.11.0/bsdkrun-supervisor-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz.sha256
