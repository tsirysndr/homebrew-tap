  # The daemon links no hypervisor itself: booting a machine is handed off to
  # `bsdkrun-supervisor`, which it finds beside itself or on PATH (see
  # daemon/src/supervisor.rs). Without it the daemon still starts and serves
  # everything that isn't a boot, but that's a crippled install, so pull it in.

  # tunnel in front — see `bsdkrund --help`.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      bsdkrund needs an access token. Set one so it survives restarts:

        BSDKRUN_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
        brew services start bsdkrund

      Started without one it generates a token and prints it on stdout, which
      under `brew services` means the log rather than your terminal:

        grep -m1 -A2 "access token" #{var}/log/bsdkrund.log

      Point a client at it:

        export BSDKRUN_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:50051   # CLI / desktop app (gRPC)
        export BSDKRUN_TOKEN=<token>

      The web UI uses the GraphQL port instead (http://127.0.0.1:50052/graphql),
      and `bsdkrun ui` serves that UI.

      It listens on loopback. Binding it to a network gives anyone who reaches
      it full VM and shell access on this host, so use TLS (--tls-cert/--tls-key)
      or an encrypted tunnel if you do.

    # A missing supervisor is a warning, not a startup failure (the daemon
